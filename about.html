                <h3>This fateful day was the time when in the vibrant city of Bangalore, a little extra beautiful girl appeared. She turned into the most charming young girl who has radiated presence, compassion, and warmth. Her smile lights up a room as if drawing all of them in, yet her laughter resonates as a sweet melody that brings people an instant sense of joy and warmth. Under that very delightful exterior lies another quirky surpriseâ€”she fears cockroaches. Indeed a rather petty phobia, yet it only adds a lovable quality to her rich personality that makes her stand out as human despite an otherwise strong character. The strength that she actually does possess will never fail to amaze me as well as others around her. It is magnificent to stand firm, face adversity and leave behind others in awe of her presence. She is important to me, and I have a gaping hole in my heart for her which cannot be filled. In our relationship, I have learned that indeed there have been moments wherein I had faltered or even failed to provide her with the type of love and care which she really deserves. Yet, despite such situations, she always replied to my failure through an enormous amount of grace and a smile so gentle that could melt any tension. The journey we've had together has surely not been devoid of trouble. But her unwavering support has been a real anchor to our relationship deepening and flourishing with time. She miraculously evolves through every tough situation that comes her way, every stretch of determination to face whatever is headed her way - personal or many more daunting external challenges. In every troubled moment she faces, I am even more convinced that she will be able to do all that she desires and aspires for. She will always be little for me and shall remain playful, open to me. I hope she feels safe in telling me her burdens; we can face them together with our friendship and understanding supporting each other. This love for her childhood memories is absolutely special, and she always expresses happiness when telling me such about her day. Every she says about her early days, it brings an old-time comfort mixed with warmth; therefore, I wanted to bring her that same happy thing from those unforgettable memories for her. The fantastic Bangalore stories, from mischief-filled school days to lighter moments we now share with each other, bring immense pride. In reality, every single one of those accounts is treasure, giving glimpses into her past; and I store them close to my heart as I learn more about the little girl she once was, who has now grown into the great young woman she is now. Weaving through these shared experiences both strengthens the bond as well as nourishes my appreciation for her life and our continued journey.</h3>
